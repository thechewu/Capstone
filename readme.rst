**Background**

This goal of this project is to provide easily available online learning material for students, as well as a simple way for teachers to create and publish such material.

The content users (students) would have to create an account to access the quizzes and exercises, and content providers (teachers) would be provided by an account which would allow them to create the problems and track their status.

Special feature of the system would be automatic assessment of the students which would determine their strengths and weaknesses, and adjust the challenges according to that.

**Project Overview**

The system features content provider-user relationship and following are overviews of both:

*Content Provider*

The teachers would have a special account that would allow them to access exercise creation and review options. System administrators would create this account in a real scenario, to assure that only appropriate individuals can create content.

There would be several predetermined formats for the exercises:  multiple choice questions, fill in the blank, and short answer question.

The content of these questions would be fully determined by the teachers, as well as the correct option(s). 

All questions will have a category and difficulty (determined originally by the provider) attached.

*Content User*

The user account would be obtained upon registration, which would give full access to the content.

The first way would be browsing the categories and selecting any available exercise, regardless of the difficulty. This approach offers instant access to wanted topics and challenges.

The second way would be through the difficulty assessment program. The system would test the user with a variety of exercises from the selected category, assessing the student’s level in that area. After the initial assessment, the user would receive the exercises appropriate for his level from the system.

The students will be able to see their stats and their history at any time.

*Assessment System*

The project will have a system in place to track each user’s progress in each of the categories and calculate their proficiency in a specific area. The resulting calculations would be used to determine appropriate exercises for the students, by focusing on improving their weaker areas, rather than giving random questions.
