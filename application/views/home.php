		<strong>Intelligent Assessment System</strong> is available to all registered users. Once you login, the link to the IAS will become available, and from there you can select a subcategory in which you would like to be assessed. The system will give you quizzes from that subcategory based on your performance. The pace of progression is dependented on your score, and extremely high, or extremely low results will have a significant impact. Default passing score is 60%, anything below will deteriorate your assessment score.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In addition to your score, the number of questions in the selected subcategory affects the progression as well. The more possible questions there are, the lower maximum adjustment per question is, which assures proper content mastery before moving on to the next level.
